# if you replaced the ssl cert of the main website and fucked up and then restored the backup, and THEN webmin fails to load,
# it needs restarting too. the piece of shit.
systemctl restart webmin # fu

# webmin refuses to load because https is fucked again. disable it:
nano \e[38;5;226m/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf\e[0m # ssl=1 -> ssl=0
systemctl restart webmin

# to then fix it you can tell it to use the main vhosts' certificate for webmin/usermin etc services too
VirtualMin (pick right host) -> Server Configuration -> SSL Certificate: "copy ssl certificate to services" or "set as default services certificate", one of those might work

# If that fails with a "Failed to save service certificates : Service webmin is not installed", edit
\e[38;5;226m/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf\e[0m again to set ssl back to 1 but \e[1mDo Not\e[0m restart the webmin service. The script
 where that error originates just checks the config apparently? Regardless, try hitting the button again.
Afterwards, the service will try restarting itself (because it has a [new] cert) and you might get more
 errors and the interface might Windows3.1 on you but whatever. https might work again.

If you didn't get that error, great!
Set ssl=1 back in \e[38;5;226m/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf\e[0m
 and then systemctl restart webmin again.

Kick it some more if needed, wtf knows.
