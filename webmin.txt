# if you replaced the ssl cert of the main website and fucked up and then restored the backup, and THEN webmin fails to load,
# it needs restarting too. the piece of shit.
systemctl restart webmin # fu

# webmin refuses to load because https is fucked again. disable it:
nano /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf # ssl=1 -> ssl=0
systemctl restart webmin

# to then fix it you can tell it to use the main vhosts' certificate for webmin/usermin etc services too
VirtualMin (pick right host) -> Server Configuration -> SSL Certificate: "copy ssl certificate to services" or "set as default services certificate", one of those might work
Then set ssl=1 back in /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf
and then systemctl restart webmin again
Kick it some more if needed, wtf knows.
