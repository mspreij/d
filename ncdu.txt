New Curses Disk Usage - aka "where has my disk space gone?!"

-e   make modified-timestamps available. \e[32;1mm\e[0m toggles them, \e[32;1mM\e[0m sorts on them (\e[32;1ms\e[0m to sort on size again)
-x   only scan the given (current?) filesystem/partition

Use \e[32;1mb\e[0m to open the current directory in a new shell (simply exit the shell to return to ncdu).

Poor man's ncdu (in docker containers, say), which only shows directory sizes:
\e[38;5;208malias ncdu="ls -lA | grep ^d | awk '{print \$9}' | xargs du -sh"\e[0m
