### looping through lines (from a textfile, say)
# read splits a line into columns on whitespace.
# read -a turns line into an array.
while read -a line; do echo ${line[0]}${line[1]}; done < file.txt
# alternatively..
cat file.txt | while read -a line; do echo ${line[0]}${line[1]}; done

# use "read foo bar bazz" to read the first 3 words (columns) into those variables.
# the last variable always gets Everything until EOL, dump that in a '_' variable to ignore
while read foo bar _; do things with ${foo} and to ${bar}; done < file.txt # only interested in the first two columns

# is my script being piped?
-t fd # True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal.
# fd can be one of the usual file descriptor assignments: 0 stdin, 1 stdout, 2 stderr
