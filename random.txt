This is not about a command "random" but literally for random shit.

# Copy file from server A to server C via localhost (or another server)
$ ssh server_A 'cat sourcefile' | ssh server_B 'cat > targetfile'

# with PROGRESS
$ ssh server_A 'cat sourcefile' | \e[32;1mpv [-s $filesize] [-i sec] |\e[0m ssh server_B 'cat > targetfile'
# optional filesize is in bytes of course, interval -i in seconds, which can be decimal 0.1
# you can add \e[38;5;208mtar\e[0m and \e[38;5;208mgunzip\e[0m and \e[38;5;208mgzip -c\e[0m to the quoted commands too.

# get directory sizes for multiple directories AND the grand total:
du -sh\e[38;5;205mc\e[0m dir1 dir2 dir3

# you can sort on 3rd column too
sort -k3 somefile.txt

# to reverse input use \e[38;5;208mtac\e[0m, not sort
tac somefile.txt
