# create a symlink
ln -s <source> <target>
# NB: \e[1;33msource is relative to target\e[0m. so if you're creating 3 symlinks at different directory levels deep,
#     you want, for example: ln -s foo bar; ln -s ../foo dir1/bar; ln -s ../../foo dir1/dir2/bar
#     maybe the -r flag helps with this, should try sometime...

# find broken links
find . -xtype l
