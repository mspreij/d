# when \e[38;5;226mchown -R <name>:<name> target\e[0m runs on a symlink it does NOT recurse, you need to add a trailing slash after the target:
$ chown -R <name>:<name> target\e[32;1m/\e[0m

# chmod -R on a symlink does \e[1mnot\e[0m require a trailing slash, and seems to make no difference.

\e[1;36mSymlinks\e[0m
# chown on a symlink affects the file the symlink points to, you can use -h for the link itself.
# chmod on a symlink \e[1monly\e[0m affects the file the symlink points to. The perms on the link itself are always 777, per man page:
  "the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links
   are never used."

# remove sticky bits
$ chmod -t foo
