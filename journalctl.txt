journalctl shows logs for systemd things (logged by systemd-journald.service)
Calling it without options shows all logs since time immemorial, which is rarely useful.
Usually it's one line per log item but occasionally a stacktrace will be dumped in there.
By default only a few items are shown, but you can run the json output through whatever.

# flags
-r               reverse (newest at top)
-f              "follow", print new log messages as they are added, like tail
--since/--until  take timeranges like "3 hours ago" or better "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"

-b               loglines from this boot (-b -1 last boot etc)
--list-boots     show 30 or so last boot/shutdowns.

# filter
-u               show logs for systemd unit like nginx.service. can be used multiple times.
_UID=n           show logs for user with user-id n. use \e[38;5;208mid <user>\e[0m to find id

# output
-o               json
                 json-pretty
                 verbose     # shows all fields
