# can simply be typed out in shell:

while true; do
    inotifywait -q -e modify \e[32;1m<file>\e[0m;
    \e[32;1maction-goes-here\e[0m
done

# inotifywait -q -e modify \e[38;5;208m<file>\e[0m
# -q         quiet
# -e <event> "modify" here. Possible values (check man pages for specifics):
  access, modify, attrib, close_write, close_nowrite, close, open, moved_to, moved_from, move, move_self,
  create, delete, delete_self, unmount
# \e[38;5;208maction-goes-here\e[0m can like run the file, scp, whatever. Go wild. Knock yourself out. Keep your pants on.
# You can stick \e[38;5;208m\\e[2J\\e[H\e[0m at the start of your script to clear the screen and set the cursor top-left again
#   (which also removes some more inotifywait output)

See also inotifywatch, maybe?
