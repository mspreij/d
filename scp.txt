# yes, you \e[1mcan\e[0m copy remote to remote using scp, but scp tries to do it "smart", that is, copy from server1 directly to server2.
# server1 might not be able to access server2 directly, or have the right credentials.
# To route traffic through the issuing local PC, use \e[38;5;208m-3\e[0m
$ scp \e[1;32m-3\e[0m user@server1:/path user@server2:/path

# of course "user@" is optional if you have a decent ~/.ssh/config

# for a simple, single file you can also simply do
$ cat file.txt | ssh <server> 'cat > file.txt'

# for a directory, see \e[38;5;208mtar\e[0m
