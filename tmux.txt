# tmux is a \e[1mT\e[22merminal \e[1mMU\e[22mltiple\e[1mX\e[22mer. It lets you split a window (the whole screen) into panes, and you
# can have multiple windows too; they're numbered, and the current one is asterisk'd, in the bottom bar.
# With a customizable prefix you can change settings/do actions etc. Default is Ctrl-b.

# capture the entire pane history and dump it to a file:
$ tmux capture-pane -eS - -p > tmux.txt
# -e = include escape sequences (most of them at least; not the non-standard 100-107 range for one)
# -S = starting line (negative is from before visible, - is from start)
# -p = print to STDOUT, otherwise it goes to some buffer thing, somewhere?

Ctrl-Space

# In copy-mode you can \e[38;5;201msearch\e[0m using
Ctrl-s [type string] <enter>
# and then n or shift-n for next/previous. Ctrl-r for reverse search
