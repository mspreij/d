Ctrl-e     open the command prompt
> help defaultkeys

Ctrl-F     find (obviously!), enter when you're done typing or the next/previous shortcuts

# things you might be searching for

Ctrl-T     open new tab (and then just Ctrl-O to open a file, tab completion works)
Alt-,/.    go to previous/next tab (doesn't wrap)
Ctrl-Q     closes a split, a tab, or if it was the last tab, the editor
