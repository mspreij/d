# grab myfile.txt from otherbranch and put it HERE, RIGHT FUCKING NOW
  $ git checkout otherbranch myfile.txt

# delete (remote) branch
  $ git push -d origin <branchname>
  $ git branch -d <branchname>
# '-D' or '-d --force' will also delete unmerged branches

# git change remote url
git remote set-url origin foo://bar/baz.git
# looks like you can also edit .git/config ?

# git puts all informative output on STDERR, which is not unixy. to not spam your inbox via crontab,
# you can use the following (in a script):
git -E fragile-command > tmp 2>&1 || mail_tmp_to_yourself
# or for a bunch of them, "cat tmp >> all_errors.txt" and check that at EOF
