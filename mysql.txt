# general query result display (running queries straight from the bash prompt with -e):
-s  # no grid-lines for query output
-N  # no headers/column names for query output
-B  # tab separated according to chatgpt?
# \e[38;5;201mNB:\e[0m when the output is piped to another process, mysql uses batch mode (tab-separated fields) and removes column names, making it
#     easier to parse

## In the client
# MySQL has a few flags/toggles that you can run interactively, '\h' will bring up a list.
#   useful ones are \s for status, \! for system commands and \\e for editing large multiline queries in a real editor

# The pager only works under 'unix', which apparently can mean 'centos but not wsl/ubuntu'. NB: when connecting to a remote host,
#   it's the abilities of the local client that count.
# While running you can enter \e[32m\P less\e[0m; when launching you can pass --pager=less or have pager=less in the config file
#   under [mysql].
# 'select foo bar bazz \G' = vertical result (more useful with a WORKING pager >.>) \G and others imply ';' and will run the query

# To connect to a Docker/Podman container from localhost, use -h 127.0.0.1; if you use localhost mysql client tries to use a unix
# socket. Unless it works regardless because wsl magic or somesuch.
