# So, there was a \e[1mgetopt\e[0m in a bygone era which had issues, so they made a \e[1mgetopts\e[0m in 1986 which was shipped with bash.
# In 1995 it was added to the Single Unix Specification (SUS).
# Then a newer one was made for Linux based on a BSD getopt, which they also named getopt. It fixes things in the original
#   getopt, and adds features that getopt\e[1ms\e[0m lacks.

# what (new) getopt DOES:
# - you tell it what flags to expect, long or short, and if they require a value
# - you give it all the args
# - it transforms them into a neat list that is easier for you to parse with while/case
# What it does NOT DO:
# - prevent invalid input. it does show an error, but will continue on.

# How it works is iffy to explain without an example:
OPTIONS=$(\e[32mgetopt\e[35;1m -o ab:c -l help\e[0m \e[34;1m-n "$0"\e[0m -- \e[31;1m"$@"\e[0m)
eval set -- "$OPTIONS"

\e[32mgetopt\e[0m           \e[36m# calls getopt \o/
\e[35;1m-o ab:c -l help\e[0m  \e[36m# expected \e[38;5;208m-o/--options\e[36m and \e[38;5;208m-l/--longoptions\e[36m are supplied here.
                 \e[36m# an option followed by ':' \e[1mrequires\e[36;22m a value, if no value is passed getopt will not pass it into $OPTIONS
\e[34;1m-n "$0"\e[0m          \e[36m# optionally pass the name of the script, used for error messages\e[0m
--               \e[36m# separate options for getopt from whatever was passed to the main script
\e[31;1m"$@"\e[0m             \e[36m# positional arguments passed to the main script, as separate strings

# then the eval..$OPTIONS" turns $OPTIONS into $1, $2, ... $n, leaving out flags for missing required values and separating
# everything neatly, so
$(getopt -o abco: -- "$@")
-abo foobar
# becomes
-a -b -o foobar

# Example use in a function:
function foo {
    local debug=off
    local myvar
    options=$(getopt -o dr:h -l help -- "$@")
    eval set -- "$options"
    while true; do
        case "$1" in          # case just looks at the first argument. if it's a -d, a var is reset
            -d)               # and the -d is taken out of args. now it goes back to the start of the loop
                debug=ON;
                shift
            ;;
            -r)               # so the next loop around, it might encounter -r and the same thing happens.
                myvar=$2;     # but because while (true) it also works if -r comes before -d
                shift 2       # note that myvar is set to the Next argument, and 2 items are shifted of remaining args
            ;;
            -h|--help )       # handle both possible options
                echo Help text goes here
                shift;;
            --)               # getopt always adds this, so filter it out. and since it's the end of options, you can break
                shift
                break;;
            *)                # first time it encounters something not in the cases, it exits the while loop.
                break
            ;;
        esac;
    done;
    # body etc
    echo debug: $debug
    echo myvar: $myvar
}
# unrelated case notes:
# - every case ends with a double ;;. This can immediately follow the preceding command or statement, like shift;;
# - yes, every case starts with \e[38;5;208mthe-thing-to-match )\e[0m , bash is weird like that.


### PHP ###

# for php the syntax is
$options = getopt(str $shortflags, array $longflags = [], int &$rest_index = null);
# short options are letters, like "abc" for optional -a -b -c flags.
# add a ':' after a flag to make it require a value: "ab:c"
# add 2 '::' to make the value optional (rarely needed)

$options = getopt('abc');
$ script.php -ca
var_export($options); \e[36m# ['c'=>false, 'a'=>false]\e[0m
# so check for flag using isset($options['b']) I guess

# $rest_index:
$options = getopt('abch', ['help'], $rest_index);
$argv = array_slice($argv, $rest_index); \e[36m# $argv now contains any remaining arguments\e[0m

# NB: getopt stops parsing input at the first non-option (ie something not starting with - or --):
$ script.php -a x -b \e[36m# ['a'=>false] - $argv if reset with \e[1m$rest_index\e[22m as above would now contain \e[1mx\e[22m and \e[1m-b\e[0m
$ script.php -a -x -b \e[36m# ['a'=>false, 'b'=>false]\e[0m
