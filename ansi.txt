This is a mix of escape sequences and stty settings.

Some random sequences that can be used in scripts
\\e[2J clear the screen
\\e[H  move the cursor to top-left
\\e[nA move cursor n places up
\\e[nB            ...down
\\e[nC      ...right
\\e[nD and left.
...

To add:
- alternative buffer
- intercepting mouse events
- move cursor to y,x location
- hide/show cursor
- dis/enable echoing input
- couple stty settings (raw, icanon, ..)
