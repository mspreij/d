Not actually documentation, just a todo/random ideas list..

Things to add or YOU KNOW to COPY FROM CHEATSHEETS:
* jq
- composer
- bat install instructions o.o;
- man: where are man pages? what are the numbers about?
- grep: exclude file/dir patterns with examples
        print ONLY filenames for wildcard file results
- wget/curl
- git o.o;
- cut? this needs to be a chapter thing in bash or ... w/e
- apt, probably
- atop
- yum
- configure/make stuff, check old C notes & kilo editor
- shopt???
* tmux
- visudo
- certinfo?

Random ideas:
 - bash_completion is a good start, but for incomplete input if there is a single match, d can load that.
   for multiple matches, prepend a message but show the first one (or all, if that is even possible?).
   for bonus points prepend a different message if only a substring match was found ('zip' for gzip)
 ? -l to list entries with last-modified date, and/or commit message
 - support multiple random-order options o.o https://stackoverflow.com/a/14203146/126584
 - d now supresses color when outputting to other process; add a flag to force color output? (also for search result and other
   non-interactive output)
 - `d foo :bar` to get only chapter bar from foo (what in the frick is 'chapter notation')
 - could even fetch and store data from some server. or local database. not sure what the advantage of this is, or if there is one..
 - if <entry> not found, offer to grep for it? or do that automatically? or count the results and decide on that? flip a coin?

Done/discarded:
 √ placeholder for comment color, to finish different-color strings inside comments.
   > how about simply "\e[0m" but only in comment lines! this would need to go Before the sed that colors
   > this even worked, shiv'd the new sed on the same line before the current one, but using \e instead of ${esc} and somehow it
     works..
 √ some type of apropos, "d -s blaat" where it simply greps for blaat in all doc files and prints a pretty result table
 √ config? things? somewhere in $D_DOCS
   √ color to use for comments
 x first line '#d ...' can be flags on how to print the rest of the file, eg
   x interpret ansi escape codes (like color)
   x attempt syntax highlighting (maybe use bat if available?)
   x there should then also be some sane - optionally configurable - defaults
   > No.
 v bash_completion
 v maybe add color support for emphasis or the commands in a description
   x example entry using this
