Not actually documentation, just a todo/random ideas list..

Things to add:
* jq
- more grep
- wget
- git o.o;
- tmux
- cut
- apt, probably

ef:
- there's a newer version of this at work probs, ~/src/ef/ or so o.o
- sort out different checks for whether it's a function or script
- find out why commenting the start of the function makes it run again without confirming, somehow
  > the function is sourced - but if it's no longer a function, that means the code will be run.. add more disclaimers!  > probs just need to `bash -n` it like the script, and then run it if there were no syntax errors (is there any way
    to detect whether it'll Do Things When Run?)
- ENV variable for path to ef's and d files should be the same, and used in both
- _init_ the local path var regardless of whether it's used o.o; a global path variable might exist and be used..
- support other langs? wrt syntax check and such

Random ideas:
- first line '#d ...' can be flags on how to print the rest of the file, eg
  - interpret ansi escape codes (like color)
  - attempt syntax highlighting (maybe use bat if available?)
  - there should then also be some sane - optionally configurable - defaults
- bash_completion
- similarly, wildcard matching or suggestions; "d var" would load vars.txt, while
  "d foo" would be like "do you want foobazz, or foobar?"
- config? things?
- ???
- d now supresses color when outputting to other process; add a flag to force color output?
- `d foo bar` to get only chapter bar from foo

v maybe add color support for emphasis or the commands in a description
  x example entry using this
