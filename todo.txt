Not actually documentation, just a todo/random ideas list..

Things to add:
* jq
- more grep
- wget
- git o.o;
- tmux
- cut
- apt, probably

Random ideas:
- first line '#d ...' can be flags on how to print the rest of the file, eg
  - interpret ansi escape codes (like color)
  - attempt syntax highlighting (maybe use bat if available?)
  - there should then also be some sane - optionally configurable - defaults
- bash_completion
- similarly, wildcard matching or suggestions; "d var" would load vars.txt, while
  "d foo" would be like "do you want foobazz, or foobar?"
- config? things?
- ???

v maybe add color support for emphasis or the commands in a description
  x example entry using this
