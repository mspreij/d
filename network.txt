# what is listening on port 1234?
$ netstat -ltnp
$ ss -ltnp
# flags: Listening only, TCP/IP connections, Numerical addresses and services (useful for non-standard ports), Process/Program name & pid
# apparently ss is the new, shinier netstat? but pipe the output through less or cat to make it /somewhat/ more readable.

# what even is in this building?
