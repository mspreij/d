# what is listening on port 1234?
$ netstat -ltnp
$ ss -ltnp
# flags: Listening only, TCP/IP connections, Numerical addresses and services (useful for non-standard ports), Process/Program name & pid
# apparently ss is the new, shinier netstat? but pipe the output through less or cat to make it /somewhat/ more readable.

NMAP
# what even is in this building?
# get the "kernel's IPv4 network neighbour" cache:
$ arp

# get the live version:
$ nmap 192.168.0.0/24
# if you get no output and wonder what it's doing, hit enter for a summary/progress report
# mind you, it can be a bold-faced liar about the time remaining >:-|

# specific ports
$ nmap -p 80,443 <ip-or-host>
# port range
$ nmap -p 1000-2000 <ip-or-host>

# If you need to sort on IP, it doesn't do numeric beyond the first dot apparently, so tell it dots are separaters and to
# sort on the 4th (say) column:
$ list ip addresses | sort \e[32;1m-t . -k4,4n\e[0m | column -t
