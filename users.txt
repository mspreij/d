### add user: adduser is the perl script that was created because useradd wasn't .. userfriendly.
$ [sudo] adduser <username>

# add 'm to sudo (or like, any other group, because sudo is just a group here), normal linux:
$ [sudo] adduser <username> sudo
# centos
$ [sudo] usermod -aG wheel <username>
# see also \e[38;5;208msudo\e[0m

# remove (including homedir & mail spool)
$ userdel -r <username>

$ id <user>      \e[36m# with more ids\e[0m
