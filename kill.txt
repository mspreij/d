# politely ask process to stop
$ kill 1234
# shoot process in the head
$ kill -9 1234

Usage:
  kill -l [name/number]
  kill [-<signal>] <pid>

# kill is used to send signals to running processes (by pid)
# by default it sends SIGTERM (15) which politely asks the process to stop.
# signal 9 or SIGKILL (or KILL) halts the process impolitely.
# but you can also use it to suspend and then continue a process, with
18 SIGCONT
19 SIGSTOP

# specified signals follow a '-'. a signal can be the name, short name or number.

# these all do the same
kill -15 123, kill -SIGTERM 123, kill -TERM 123

-l [number/name]  # list signals (supply a number to get signal name, or vice versa)
