So this is like docker with a red hat on.
If your setup is cursed and you're using systemd to manage your containers, "podman run <thing>" might work less well
  then \e[32msystemctl --user restart whateverthehellitwas.service\e[0m. I dunno.

# there is a fair amount of detailed help
podman help volume ls \e[36m# show help on the \e[38;5;208mls\e[36m sub-command of the \e[38;5;208mvolume\e[36m command\e[0m

# you can list images, volumes, containers, and probably more.
# most have an -a toggle for also-the-ones-not-in-use
#                         shortcuts
podman volume ls
podman image ls           podman images
podman container ls       podman ps

# list random usage info
podman system df

# clean up, this is almost always safe
podman image prune [-a]
# figure out how much it will probably reclaim:
podman system df
# list the images and their space:
podman images --format '{{.ID}} {{.Size}} {{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}'

# get oodles of json to parse through for useful things.
podman generate spec <container> | less
podman inspect <container> | less
# maybe run through fx instead of less

# without systemd
podman run <image> # creates new container from image which is fetched if necessary
# so run is like a shortcut for fetch/build and start

podman start <container> # existing container
