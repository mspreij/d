So this is like docker with a red hat on.
If your setup is cursed and you're using systemd to manage your containers, "podman run <thing>" might work less well
  then \e[32msystemctl --user restart whateverthehellitwas.service\e[0m. I dunno.

# list running containers [or all of them]
podman ps [-a]

# get oodles of json to parse through for useful things
podman generate spec <container> | less
podman inspect <container> | less

# without systemd
podman run <image> # creates new container from image which is fetched if necessary
podman start <container> # existing container
