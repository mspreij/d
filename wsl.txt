/etc/resolv.conf symlinks /mnt/wsl/resolv.conf which is automatically generated, and will put a nameserver in there which does not nameserve afaict. maybe it needs things in the firewall to not be blocked, I dunno. put 8.8.8.8 and turn of autogeneration by putting

[network]
generateResolvConf = false

in /etc/wsl.conf. Or something. I dunno. It seems to just revert somehow sometimes.
