I keep forgetting flags/options for rarely used commands so I put them in txt files that I can throw on the screen.
'd' contains the bash function, edit local dir as you see fit. This should be an env thing maybe?

That's about it.

Todo:
- bash_completion
- config? things?
- ???
v maybe add color support for emphasis or the commands in a description
  x example entry using this
