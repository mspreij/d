I keep forgetting flags/options for rarely used commands so I put them in txt files that I can throw on the screen.
Often the mere act of writing the stuff down and saving it already makes me remember it and then this utility makes itself irrelevant but, you know.

Popular community ones are https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr and https://github.com/cheat/cheat
I use cheat too, but had already written d and it has more personal things I forget, so..

'd' contains the bash function. It looks for the txt files in ~/.my_stuff/docs by default, or if set, in $D_DOCS.

See todo.txt for things.
