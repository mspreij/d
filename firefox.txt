When the retarded thing keeps insisting on \e[31mHTTPS\e[0m instead of \e[34mHTTP\e[0m, even when given a specific port, go to
  the site entry in history, right-click and do a \e[35m"forget about this site"\e[0m. you might lose the cached

Jesus Christ Almighty what a fat slice of failure.

  signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled (create if needed)

The "add custom search engine" <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-custom-search-engine/> which is pretty awesome works
