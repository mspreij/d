When the retarded thing keeps insisting on \e[31mHTTPS\e[0m instead of \e[34mHTTP\e[0m, even when given a specific port, go to
  the site entry in history, right-click and do a \e[35m"forget about this site"\e[0m. you might lose the cached
  password, it might stick around in the password manager, wtf knows.

Jesus Christ Almighty what a fat slice of failure.

To allow importing passwords from the logins.csv that is created by exporting passwords, set this to true in about:config
  signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled (create if needed)
