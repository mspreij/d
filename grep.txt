# this is a /mostly/ correct interpretation of the man pages, the details on regex are hairy and depend on the grep
# version and implementation

-i   case-insensitive
-v   negate matches (invert result)
-e   use for each pattern if you have more than one to match or negate (it ORs)
-E   extended regex

--include \*.php  # only search these files. either escape the * or quote the string

### output
-H   print filename with each match (default for wildcard file patterns)
-n   print line number
[-A, -B, -C]#  print # lines after, before, or around matching lines

# filter out empty lines for, say, -v, by using a start/end pattern ^$
$ grep -v -e foobar -e ^$
