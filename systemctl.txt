# reload things after changing service files
systemctl daemon-reload \e[36m# season with sudo and --user to taste\e[0m

Shamelessly copy/pasted from tldr:

Control the systemd system and service manager.
Some subcommands such as `disable`, `status`, `reboot` etc. have their own usage documentation.
More information: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html

----

Systemd manages services. Services are run system-wide or in a user session.
The files that describe services live in:

/usr/lib/systemd/[user|system]/   # installed by software, no need to touch
/etc/systemd/[user|system]/       # overrides by the system admin
~/.config/systemd/user/           # overrides by the user

Services can be started/stopped by timers, path changes, socket traffic, at boot, on mounts, etc.
Mostly you'll be using timers, occasionally paths, maybe sockets.

Services, timers, path, socket etc files have a similar structure with three sections:
[Unit] description, dependencies, ordering
[$type] what kind of thing it is. This will be [Timer], or [Path], etc.
[Install] where `systemctl enable` should wire it under.

Every section has a bunch of key=value pairs.
