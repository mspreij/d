# gzip only operates on SINGLE FILES.
# use `tar z` for directories with \e[33;1mc\e[0mreate or e\e[33;1mx\e[0mtract

-d  decompress                 # aka `gunzip`
-c  redirect output to STDOUT

zcat == gzip -dc == gunzip -c == decompress to STDOUT
if you want to zcat | less, \e[38;5;202mzless\e[0m is also a thing

# default behaviour is to work on the same file; to keep the original file, output and redirect the result "manually"
gzip -c file > file.gz
