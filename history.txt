# the man page is for the history library or somesuch? use help:
$ help history
# for when you're doing password things on the cli:
-c    clear history
# when you want to continue your session in a second pane
-w    write history to the history file (which is read for new shells)

# random other things that you'll never ever need
-s args..  store the rest of the args in history without executing them (the command that does or calls this will
           not be stored itself)
-p !foo    echo the most recent history entry that starts with foo, without running \e[1mTHE FIRST PART\e[0m of it
# this ties in with bash' expansion of !stuff. !-3 will run the third-last command again,
#   !123 runs command nr 123 (according to the history list)
# \e[38;5;201mNB:\e[0m if the most recent history entry contained multiple ;-delimited commands, those after the first one \e[1mWILL\e[0m be run.
# SO THAT SUCKS.
# USE THIS SHORTCUT INSTEAD
$ !foo\e[38;5;201m:p\e[0m
# that prints it, and adds it to your history as most recent command so you can arrow-up to edit it.

# Disable & re-enable storing commands in history:
$ set +o history
$ set -o history

# the following is mostly copy/pasted from a random .bashrc file:

# don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.
# See bash(1) for more options
HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth

# append to the history file, don't overwrite it
shopt -s histappend

# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)
HISTSIZE=1000
HISTFILESIZE=2000

# show with timestamps
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
