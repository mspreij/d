# as with all things created by committees or experts, there are 3247 options and features of which

# openssl works with a few dozen "sub-commands", each with their own arguments etc etc. The man pages could comprise a fair-
#   sized book.

# Some common sub-commands:
req           # generate certificate request, optionally along with private key
x509          # certificate display & signing utility
version [-a]  # get version. \e[38;5;202m-a\e[0m for a bunch of compile-time settings, options, vars and flags (useful for bugreports)

# create new certificate signing request (CSR) based on existing certificate and key
openssl x509 \e[38;5;202m-x509toreq\e[0m -in ssl.cert -signkey ssl.key -out ssl.csr.new

# CentOS 7 won't update to OpenSSL 1.1 (support dropped december 2019) but invites you to install "openssl11" for spot usage.
