On Unix, everything is a file \o/

Disks are, obviously, also files, and they live in /dev (for device). Specifically, they are files of type "block device" or
  "block special file" (indicated by the 'b' before the permissions in ls -l), meaning they cache and write data per block,
  as opposed to per character (like character devices do, that is mice or audio card or..).

Originally sd meant \e[32;1mS\e[0mCSI \e[32;1mD\e[0misk, then it was used for any additional disk (like connected USB drives).
sd\e[32;1ma\e[0m, sd\e[32;1mb\e[0m, sd\e[32;1mc\e[0m andsoforth are the 1st..3rd disks that the computer finds upon booting. After 26 in theory it goes to sdAa, sdAb, ..
Then the numbers refer to the partitions on those disks.

So: sdb3 = 3rd partition on the second (b) disk (sd)
