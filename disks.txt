\e[33mwtf is "sdb3"?\e[0m
On Unix, everything is a file \o/

Disks are, obviously, also files, and they live in /dev (for device). Specifically, they are files of type "block device" or
  "block special file" (indicated by the 'b' before the permissions in ls -l), meaning they cache and write data per block,
  as opposed to per character (like character devices do, that is mice or audio card or..).

Originally sd meant \e[32;1mS\e[0mCSI \e[32;1mD\e[0misk, then it was used for any additional disk (like connected USB drives).
sd\e[32;1ma\e[0m, sd\e[32;1mb\e[0m, sd\e[32;1mc\e[0m andsoforth are the 1st..3rd disks that the computer finds upon booting. After 26 in theory it goes to sdAa, sdAb, ..
Then the numbers refer to the partitions on those disks.

So: sdb3 = 3rd partition on the second (b) disk (sd)

\e[33mLVM:\e[0m Logical Volume Manager, one of many forms of storage virtualization. "A method of allocating space on mass-storage devices that is more flexible than conventional partitioning schemes to store volumes. In particular, a volume manager can concatenate, stripe together or otherwise combine partitions (or block devices in general) into larger virtual partitions that administrators can re-size or move."

\e[33mLUKS:\e[0m Linux Unified Key Setup is a disk encryption specification: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup

\e[33mLUN:\e[0m Logical Unit Number, a number used to identify a logical unit, which is a device addressed by the SCSI protocol or by Storage Area Network protocols that encapsulate SCSI, such as Fibre Channel or iSCSI. Glad you asked? Basically it seems to be most useful as a volume identifier for virtual volumes like in LVM, although it's also used for existing/older scsi things. apparently. or something. Just read it as "points to a disk" maybe.
