# Ubuntu / Debian: \e[33m/var/spool/cron/crontabs/\e[0m has files for each user
# For Redhat / Centos, they're under \e[33m/var/spool/cron/\e[0m

# hourly/daily/weekly/monthly scripts live in \e[33m/etc/cron.*\e[0m
# on some systems they seem to by run by \e[33m/etc/crontab\e[0m? on others they seem to just run, who knows

# there's also /etc/cron.d/ for ... generic crons that are not hourly/daily-etc. All these crons also include
#   a column for the username.
