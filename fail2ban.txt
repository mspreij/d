https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8 (this documentation is not complete and utter shit FOR A CHANGE)

# There is a \e[33mfail2ban-server\e[0m which just runs, and a \e[33mfail2ban-client\e[0m which starts/reloads/stops the server
#   and sends it all the configuration.

$ man jail.conf

# the too-short;didn't-bother-reading of it is there are
# - \e[33mfilters\e[0m: regular expressions that match patterns in logfiles, thresholds (x times in y minutes) and such
# - \e[33mactions\e[0m: [groups of] commands to execute, eg send mail, add rules to iptables and/or firewalld
# - \e[33mjails\e[0m: combinations of a filter and one or more actions: if a filter triggers, the actions will run

# more or less everything lives in \e[38;5;226m/etc/fail2ban\e[0m

# By default, jails and filters have the same name, so a jail doesn't need to explicitly define its filter.

# get some stats on a specific jail
$ fail2ban-client status <jail>
