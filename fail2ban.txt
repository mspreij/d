https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8 (this documentation is not complete and utter shit FOR A CHANGE)

# There is a \e[33mfail2ban-server\e[0m which just runs, and a \e[33mfail2ban-client\e[0m which starts/reloads/stops the server
#   and sends it all the configuration. You can also do this from systemctl, but apparently the two methods are not compatible.

$ man jail.conf

# the too-short;didn't-bother-reading of it is there are
# - \e[33mfilters\e[0m: regular expressions that match patterns in logfiles, thresholds (x times in y minutes) and such
# - \e[33mactions\e[0m: [groups of] commands to execute, eg send mail, add rules to iptables and/or firewalld
# - \e[33mjails\e[0m: combinations of a filter and one or more actions: if a filter triggers, the actions will run

# more or less everything lives in \e[38;5;226m/etc/fail2ban\e[0m, but it keeps state in a sqlite db in \e[38;5;226m/var/lib/fail2ban/\e[0m
# the logfile is conveniently \e[38;5;226m/var/log/fail2ban.log\e[0m

# By default, jails and filters have the same name, so a jail doesn't need to explicitly define its filter.
# also good to know: variables can be defined \e[1mafter\e[0m they're used, and the config in general relies a lot on variables and default
# values, which can come from pretty much anywhere.

$ fail2ban-client status             \e[36m# list jails\e[0m
$ fail2ban-client status <jail>      \e[36m# get some stats on a specific jail like 'sshd'\e[0m
$ fail2ban-client get <jail> bantime \e[36m# get various properties of this jail\e[0m
$ fail2ban-client -h|--help          \e[36m# get help (the 'help' command doesn't seem to work, only these options)\e[0m
$ fail2ban-client set <jail> unbanip <address> \e[36m# unban an IP address\e[0m

# random script that checks today's logs for (un)bans

#!/usr/bin/env bash
