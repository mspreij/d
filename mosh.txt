# to kill dead mosh server sessions, just
$ kill <all the pids that that message gives you>
# yes, you still have to write or find a script for this, but that's the manual version.

# NB: mosh works with "rectangles of text", you can't scroll up in a mosh session. Making the window
#     or pane larger will not give you more text.
