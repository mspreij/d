-n      does something with /dev/null and stdin, making ssh work in a while loop. for loops don't need this.
-A:     agent forwarding: your ssh keys are now available to SSH on the remote host as well
-G foo: get all settings for host foo from the .ssh/config file (and a shitton more, | less for finding things)

# check /etc/ssh/sshd_config syntax before restarting the service:
$ sshd -t

Todo:
- ssh-keygen
- ssh-copy-id
- ssh-agent & ssh-add
