-n      does something with /dev/null and stdin, making ssh work in a while loop. for loops don't need this.
-A:     agent forwarding: your ssh keys are now available to SSH on the remote host as well
-G foo: get all settings for host foo from the .ssh/config file (and a shitton more, | less for finding things)

# To give multiple commands to be run remotely over ssh, quote the lot, or escape the \; thing between them
# Completely randomly, you can add newlines to files by doing \e[33mecho >> foo.txt\e[0m
# Mind you still have to quote the >> or the whole thing when ssh'ing the command.

# Check /etc/ssh/sshd_config syntax before restarting the service:
$ sshd -t

Todo:
- ssh-keygen
- ssh-copy-id
v ssh-agent & ssh-add

"SSH protocol v.1 is no longer supported"
# this can mean you need to use a capital P for port if you're using a lowercase p. It can also mean you
# need to use a lowercase p for port if you're using a capital P. Don't ask.
