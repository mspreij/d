TTL = 0?
# if you see 0 where you expect a number, check for ";; WARNING: recursion requested but not available"
# this means the DNS server was not able to "recurse" to other DNS servers, and only had this IP address in its cache
# run it again with @8.8.8.8 for example

# It might also return an AUTHORITY SECTION instead of an ANSWER SECTION which contains the dns server you should ask
# instead. Sometimes nested subdomains are handled by a different DNS server.

# get ALL THE INFO
$ dig foo.bar ANY

# get only the ip address (or, like, emptiness for not found). It will also return a CNAME if there is one.
