TTL = 0?
# if you see 0 where you expect a number, check for ";; WARNING: recursion requested but not available"
# this means the DNS server was not able to "recurse" to other DNS servers, and only had this IP address in its cache

# get ALL THE INFO
$ dig foo.bar ANY

# get only the ip address (or, like, emptiness for not found)
$ dig +short foo.bar
