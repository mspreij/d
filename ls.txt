ls

-- Basic ls usage to go here... --

 In the list format, the first character, before the permissions, indicates the type of 'file':
 -  regular file
 d  directory
 l  symbolic link
 b  block special file/block device:           tends to be storage devices, buffers output, writes per block
 c  character special file/character device:   tends to be audio/graphics cards, keyboard, mouse
 C  high performance ("contiguous data") file  
 D  door (Solaris 2.5 and up)
 M  off-line ("migrated") file (Cray DMF)
 n  network special file (HP-UX)
 p  FIFO (named pipe)
 P  port (Solaris 10 and up)
 s  socketqq

# If there's a \e[38;5;201m+\e[0m sign trailing the permissions, that file/directory has extended permissions called ACLs for Access
# Control List. use \e[38;5;208mgetfacl <file>\e[0m or \e[38;5;208mls -le [file]\e[0m to view them, depending on OS.
