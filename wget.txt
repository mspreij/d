$ wget domain.com

$ wget http://domain.com:8080/etc

--server-response / -S         print response headers
--quiet / -q                   turn of wget output (progress bars can ef up the content)
--output-document / -O <file>  save response data to different filename; - for STDOUT
--no-hsts                      do NOT automatically switch to https when asking for the http response specifically..
--max-redirect=<number>        how many times to follow "Location: .." headers, can be set to 0 which is useful to
                               debug redirects with --server-response

# NB: & in the url will cut off remaining arguments and push the task into the background, printing a PID, the prompt, and *then* all the
#     output. Quote your URL.

# NB: wget will upgrade \e[38;5;208mhttp\e[0m requests to \e[38;5;208mhttps\e[0m requests automatically if it knows the server supports it, use
#     --no-hsts to prevent.
#     if shit fails, carefully read the output before the response data (no -q) to check for funny stuff.
