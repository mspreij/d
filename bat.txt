# no man page:
$ bat --help

# bat has its own ideas about what to color in, say, logfiles. Using \e[32m--color never\e[0m it will not add colors, but still
#   print ansi colors already in the file. It doesn't seem to believe in coloring past the first linebreak though..

# remove bat's fancy lines and numbers and such
-p / --plain
# specify syntax to use for coloring (accepts language or extension)
-l <language>
