# basically check the line at the bottom, myeah?
# different versions of nano support different things, but for those that do..
# if Alt is not available or does weird stuff, Esc can be used as separate keypress instead

Alt-a    set start- and end-marks for copy/cutting; Shift-cursor keys might also work!
Ctrl-k   cut marked text or line (including trailing newline) into (nano) buffer
Ctrl-u   un-cut buffer to cursor position
Alt-6    copy marked text or line into buffer

Alt-u    undo
Alt-e    redo

# 
Ctrl-r   read new file into current or new buffer
Alt-f    toggle between current/new buffer for Ctrl-r behaviour above, for newer nanos
         this only works while in the Ctrl-r "dialog"
Alt->    (that is, Alt-Shift-. or Esc, '>') go to next buffer

Alt-c    toggle cursor position display
