Alt-a       set start- and end-marks for copy/cutting; Shift-cursor keys might also work!
Alt-delete  removes a marked area without putting it into the cut buffer; With set zap or $ nano -Z
            regular delete and backspace work too.
            While a selection is active, Ctrl-O turns into "Write Selection to File: " with no filename
Ctrl-k   cut marked text or line (including trailing newline) into (nano) buffer
Ctrl-u   un-cut buffer to cursor position
Alt-6    copy marked text or line into buffer

Alt-u    undo
Alt-e    redo
Ctrl-up/down   no idea what version this was added, but this moves the cursor to the previous/next paragraph
Alt-+/-      scrolls without moving the caret (until the caret hits the top/bottom, then it scrolls along)

# comment. I forgot what was going to be here.
Ctrl-r   read new file into current or new buffer
Ctrl-r-t cursorable file chooser! o.o why am I discovering this by accident??
Alt-f    toggle between current/new buffer for Ctrl-r behaviour above, for newer nanos
         this only works while in the Ctrl-r "dialog"
Alt-.    (or Esc, '.') go to next buffer
Alt-c    toggle cursor position display
Alt-#    toggle line numbers on the left (Alt-Shift-3)
Alt-o    toggle tab -> spaces ('set tabsize 4' or so in .nanorc)
Alt-y    toggle syntax highlighting
Alt-s    toggle wrapping long lines (or: Esc, s)

# read different .nanorc:
$ nano --rcfile blaa.nanorc

# syntax hilighting is guessed by extension, tell it what to use with -Y:
$ nano -Y php foobar

# If syntax highlighting still doesn't work, or is just regular/bold instead of colors, experiment
#   with your TERM variable.
