Alt-a       set start- and end-marks for copy/cutting; Shift-cursor keys might also work!
Alt-delete  removes a marked area without putting it into the cut buffer; With set zap or $ nano -Z
            regular delete and backspace work too.
            While a selection is active, Ctrl-O turns into "Write Selection to File: " with no filename
Ctrl-k   cut marked text or line (including trailing newline) into (nano) buffer
Ctrl-u   un-cut buffer to cursor position
Alt-6    copy marked text or line into buffer

Alt-u    undo
Alt-e    redo
Ctrl-up/down   no idea what version this was added, but this moves the cursor to the previous/next paragraph

# 
Ctrl-r   read new file into current or new buffer
Alt-f    toggle between current/new buffer for Ctrl-r behaviour above, for newer nanos
         this only works while in the Ctrl-r "dialog"
Alt->    (that is, Alt-Shift-. or Esc, '>') go to next buffer

Alt-c    toggle cursor position display
