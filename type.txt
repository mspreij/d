# return what foo is, how it would be interpreted as command. for regular files use `file`.
$ type foo

# No flags return human-readable information: alias/function definition, 'x is a shell builtin/keyword', file location.# NB: aliases can override command paths, ie there can be multiple answers; type only shows the first by default.

-t    only return string: alias, keyword, function, builtin, file. No match = no output, exit 1
-p/P  interpret as file and return path
      -P forces a PATH search (according to the man page, anyway) but only returns 1 match even with -a
      -p returns all matches with -a but nothing when an alias overrides the command/script
-a    return all matches

# pipe function output from `type` through `tail -n+2` to lose the first line and cat >> to a file or something
#   voice of experience: make sure you're not overwriting the file with just that function o.o;
#   also also: you lose all comments in the function source

# see also: command, builtin, whereis
