# By default, "yum update" considers the whole thing a transaction and will error out if a single package fails, even if
# the others don't depend on it:
# - if it's a dependency issue you can force it through with --skip-broken
# - if it's a key issue, you can install the key again with "rpm --install <keyurlfrommessage>"
#   or exclude that package from the update with `yum update --exclude=google-chrome-stable`
#   or as said, disabling the key check for that package.
