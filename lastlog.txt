# NB: last and lastlog and other functions won't always agree with eachother - like, /var/log/secure says a session was
#     opened for johndoe Jun 28 15:40:52; lastlog -u johndoe says May 30 15:34:47, last yields nothing but says it started
#     logging May 25th. So, ya know, who knows.

# see last login [for user]
$ lastlog [-u <username>]

# see all logins for the last month or so [or the last 10] [for user]
# the -w is for showing full username & host (why isn't this default..)
$ last -w [-10/-n 10] [<user>]
# show reboots
$ last reboot

# man last returns more fascinating stuff which I can't see working atm.
