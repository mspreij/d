# no, sed doesn't understand linebreaks, but it *does* understand line _beginnings_, so in case you were trying to
# indent some string or output again:
echo -n "$foo" | sed 's/^/  /'
echo
# the -n and last echo are optional, in case padding the last linebreak of $foo presents formatting issues

# single quotes in sed is often hassle, maybe it supports \\x27 notation. if not can you wrap the expression
# in double quotes?

# using sed to color certain substrings; basically use \\x1b for ESC
echo 12345367 | sed 's/3/\\x1b[31m3\\x1b[0m/g'
